  <h2>To those that are asking: "Why is everything always about race?"</h2>
  <h2>No one made it about race until the oppressors did. During the Jim Crow era, African-American citizens didn't ask for segregated bathrooms, schools, water fountains, churches, hotels, bars, hospitals, parks, and telephone booths. The white Americans did. African-American people don't ask to be treated differently due to their race, yet the oppressors take it on themselves to do it anyway. Before you ask, "Why is everything about race?", ask yourself who made it that way.</h2>
