<h2> July 14th, 1822, was the set date for a slave revolt in Charleston, South Carolina that Denmark Vesey planned.</h2>
<span id="dots"></span><span id="more">
<h2>The revolt did not go through because that June, many nervous enslaved people reported the plan to the slave owners. Because of this, the authorities in Charleston started arresting those that were leading the revolt and Vesey was captured and brought to trial.</h2>
