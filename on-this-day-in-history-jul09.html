<h2>  On July 9th, 1893, Dr. Daniel Hale Williams, an African-American doctor, performed the first successful open heart surgery.</h2>
<span id="dots"></span><span id="more">
<h2>  Daniel Hale Williams, (1858-1931) opened the first interracial hospital due to African-American citizens being prohibited from being admitted to hospitals as well as the refusal to staff African-American medical professionals. Dr. Williams knew this must change and therefore, in 1891, he opened Provident Hospital and Training School for Nurses. This was the first hospital in the nation with integrated staff.</h2>
  <h2> Two years later, in 1893, Dr. Williams performed surgery on James Cornish, who was brought to the hospital with a severe stab wound on his chest. Dr. Williams did not have access to any advanced surgical tools or even a blood transfusion, yet the surgery was a success and made history as the world's first successful open-heart surgery.</h2>
