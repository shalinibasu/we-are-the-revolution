<h2>On July 7th, 1930, the building of the Hoover Dam began. And though this project may have seemed like a life saver to many white-American citizens at the time of the economic depression, the times still remained dreary for African-American citizens.</h2>
<span id="dots"></span><span id="more"><h2> The U.S. government required that American citizens be hired for the project. No race other than "Mongolians" was explicitly excluded. However, it became clear that the definition of "American citizen" really just meant white American citizen.</h2>
  <h2>None of the first 1,000 people hired were African-American. It was said that no African-American citizens were hired for fear of racial tension and strife on the work grounds. This assumption was proved true in 1962 when violence almost broke out in northern Nevada because a Mexican-American man was put in charge of a white crew. </h2>
  <h2>After Six Companies (the company in charge of hiring for this project) was put under pressure, they promised to increase their hiring for African-American citizens. However, by 1933, there were still only 24 African-American workers. And along with this, African-American workers were to work in the gravel pits in Arizona, which was the hottest place on the site.</h2>
