  <h2 class="edu-para">Sign <a href="https://www.change.org/p/greg-abbott-pardon-black-woman-imprisoned-for-voting?utm_content=cl_sharecopy_13513769_en-US%3Av1&recruiter=319353471&recruited_by_id=129af720-1490-11e5-9c6e-8515d331dad3&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink&utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_initial&utm_term=50bd38eb3cd647ea9681819861c8f293">this</a> petition today.</h2>
  <h2 class="edu-para">Signing this petition calls on Governor Abbott of Texas to pardon Crystal Mason. She faces at least 5 years in prison for just trying to vote. In 2016, Mason went to vote while she was considered inellgible by the state meaning that she couldn't vote due to being on "federal supervised release." This was an honest mistake which should not have resulted in 5 or more years in prison.</h2>
