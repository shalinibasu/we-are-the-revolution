<h2>  On July 13th, 1787, Congress passed the Northwest Land Ordinance of 1787 which outlawed slavery in the Northwest territory.</h2>
<span id="dots"></span><span id="more">
<h2> The passing of this ordinance created a geographical divide between slave states and free states which would become of great significance in the next century during the American Civil War. </h2>
<h2>  To pass the ordinance, states had to unanimously consent to it. And the southern slave states consented to the prohibition of slavery in the Northwest territory because they beleived that their own right to slavery was protected due to the Articles of Confederation and they also had their own selfish economic interests in mind. The main crop in the South was tobacco and the slave owners found success with this crop due to the labor of those that were enslaved. And with slave labor being prohibited in the Northwest, it would mean that tobacco would not be grown there, making their own economy boom. This also protected the South from competition.</h2>
