  <h2 class="edu-para">AJ Mitchell, a 19 year old boy who had autism, died in November of 2019. He was ordering food when his card got declined. As an individual with autism, he was clearly upset. The employees beat Mitchell until the police arrived who then restrained him. By the time Mitchell's mother arrived, he was laying face down in the parking lot with a bag over his head while the police kneeled on his back. He was taken to the hospital by his mother where he died only 15 minutes later. Say his name.</h2>
  <h2 class="edu-para"> Too many individuals have died at the hands of police brutality due to the police's lack of education in dealing with those who have mental illnesses and/or disabilites. This CANNOT continue to happen. Sign the petition to bring upon change. Say AJ Mitchell's name.</h2>
