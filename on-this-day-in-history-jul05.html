<h2>On July 5th, 1975, Arthur Ashe became the first black man to win Wimbledon.</h2>
<span id="dots"></span><span id="more"><h2>Arthur Ashe (1943-1993) grew up in Richmond, Virgina which was, then, heavily segregated. He also became the first black man to win a Grand Slam title when he was just 25 years old. This happened at the 1968 U.S. Open. His success did not stop there. Ashe went on to win many more torunaments as well as desegregate a very white dominant, "lily-white" sport. He also became a rather eloquent activist as he fought for civil rights, expressed opposition to the Arpatheid (a system of legislation in South Africa of segragationalist polices against non-white citizens), and he also spread awareness about AIDS.</h2>
