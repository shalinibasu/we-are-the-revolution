<h2>On July 6th 1957, Althea Gibson became the first African American person to win Wimbledon.</h2>
<span id="dots"></span><span id="more"><h2>Althea Gibson (1927-2003) grew up in Clarendon County, South Carolina. She used to get in trouble at school which made her turn to sports. Gibson used to have to wait until her local tennis courts closed at night before she could go and practice on them as South Carolina was heavily segregated at the time. She became the first African-American person to win a Grand Slam title. She also won the American Tennis Association (ATA) tournament 10 years in a row. No one had acheived that many consecutive wins at ATA before her and nobody has acheived that since. In 1957 and 1958, Gibson became the number one tennis player in the world. She retired in 1958 and started touring with the Harlem Globe Trotters where she would do exhibition tennis matches before the games. Althea Gibson has left a lasting legacy on sports as a woman of color who broke so many boundaries during such a difficult time to do so.</h2>
