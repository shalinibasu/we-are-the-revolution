<h2>  On July 8th, 1776, the Liberty Bell first rang from Independence Hall. However, the bell got its name as well as its iconic importance from the abolition movement from the 1830s as it was adopted as a symbol of freedom at that time.</h2>

<h2>  It is also important to note that although the Bell became a symbol of freedom particularly during the abolition movement, bells can be linked to much oppresion that enslaved people faced. Enslaved people were often forced to answer to plantation bells when working the fields and had to wear <a href="https://longstreet.typepad.com/thesciencebookstore/2012/06/jf-1-5-of-5-items-a-narrative-of-the-adventures-and-escape-of-moses-roper.html">personally fitted bells</a> so that they could not escape.</h2>
  <h2>  The Liberty Bell is inscribed with Lectivus 25:10, "Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof." This refers to the Year of Jubilee and according to Hebrew tradition, that was when slaves were to be set free. Yet, for this to be inscribed on the Bell in the 1700s was hypocrisy as not all people were granted liberty and slavery still persisted.</h2>
  <h2>  In 1844, abolitionist and publisher of <a href="https://transcription.si.edu/project/11766">The Liberator</a>, William Lloyd Garrison focused on the true meaning of the inscribed quote when he re-printed the sonnet "<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mdover/website/libertybell.htm">The Liberty Bell</a>." The line in this sonnet, "Ring it, til the slave be free," was a direct criticism of the inscription because the inscribed quote promotes liberty for all inhabitants yet slavery remained for over a century longer (and even still exists today in our country's prison system).</h2>
