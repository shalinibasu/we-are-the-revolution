<span id="dots"></span><span id="more">
<h2>Eric Garner was confronted and arrested for the suspicion of illegally selling cigarettes. During his arrest, he was tackled to the ground and put in an illegal chokehold by Daniel Pantaleo. He pleaded for breath 11 times. His lasts words were "I can't breathe." To this day, black people are being killed in similar and almost identical circumstances. And the officers that murdered them face little to no reprecaution. Take action. Demand justice. His name was Eric Garner. SAY HIS NAME. REMEMBER HIS NAME.</h2>
