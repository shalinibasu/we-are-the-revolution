<h2> The Niagara Movement was organized after 29 business owners, teachers, and clergy were denied admittance to a hotel in Buffalo, New York and then gathered at the first meet in Niagara Falls, Ontario.</h2>
<h2>The mission of the Niagara Movement was to bring upon legal change in the criminal system, economy, religion, health, and education. This organization stood out because of their unmistakable demand for equality as they forcefully demanded various rights regarding suffrage, education, and economics.</h2>
